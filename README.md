# Naxos
We started this app during the 2019 FirstNet Hackathon! Naxos is a cross-platforum application that will notify EMS and surronding communities in the event of a love one or someone you know OD on Opiods. This app will alert anyone who has the known drug, narcan, and is willing to adminster it to the invidual. This app was built focusing on communituy engagement, helping First Responders espically EMS, and fighting back against the Opioid crisis that is happening here in Indiana and around the country!
